<h2 id="glyphs-menu">GLYPHS MENU</h2>
<h3 id="about">About</h3>
<p>The glyphs menu feature allows the user to complete words using a menu of letters in addition to the letters that are on the board. On the left of the screen is a menu with five letters in it, if the user is struggling to complete a word and needs an extra letter to do so, this feature would be useful. The user can simply stop dragging their mouse on the grid, press on the needed glyph from the menu, and then start dragging their mouse on the grid again to form a word that includes letters from the board plus a letter from the menu.</p>
<p>The screenshots below show how a letter from the menu on the left can be used to add letters as part of a word being matched.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="creating-the-glyphs-menu">Creating the Glyphs Menu</h3>
<p>To make the glyphs menu, our group had to make a button menu and save the glyph or letter that was pressed. We also had to allow the user to choose words from an places other than the grid itself. Originally, the code stored the player’s selection as an array of positions on the grid. To make the glyphs menu, we allowed this array to contain special entries indicating positions within the glyphs menu instead of positions on the board. Other code, such as the code that highlights the selected glyphs, had to be changed to allow for this. The new code stores the index of a letter within the menu, and then that letter is used to form part of the word being constructed.</p>
<h3 id="challenges">Challenges</h3>
<p>The game is designed to be played in many different languages. One of the biggest questions we were facing was how to make it more accessible in many different languages. Another challenge we faced was working with a large amount of pre-existing code. Instead of simply building our feature as a stand-alone thing, we had to fit it into the other systems of the game that were already in place.</p>
<h3 id="future-work">Future Work</h3>
<p>As the game develops, the Glyphs menu could be made mutable. It should give the user options of adding more letters than just five and once a letter/glyph is selected it could be used up and disappear from the menu. However, these are all design questions and depend on other potential features of the game, like player progression.</p>

<h2 id="quiz-mode">QUIZ MODE</h2>
<p>If you would like to use this feature, we have a game initialized with a demo word list linked <a href="https://solsword.github.io/words/index.html#mode=quiz,words=science`definition%25201~computer`definition%25202~coding`definition%25203~html`definition%25204~css`definition%25205~javascript`definition%25206,domain=English">here</a>. You can also upload your own file into the quiz mode at this link: <a href="https://solsword.github.io/words/start_quiz.html">Start Quiz</a>.</p>

<h3 id="about-quiz-mode">About Quiz Mode</h3>
<p>In quiz mode, a user can upload a custom word list on a separate page from the main game. First, the user must create a text file. The format for putting words into the file is described on the “Start Quiz” page linked above. Once they have their text file ready, they can choose which ‘domain’ that their text file falls under. Currently, our program supports English, Japanese (かな), Turkish (Türk), Chinese idioms (成语), and Arabic (عربى), although most of those domains are incomplete in some way. Then, our program generates a link that encodes the words (and their definitions, if applicable) so that Words knows which words to use in the custom version of the game. Right now, our game does not have the capability to use the definitions, but we hope that someone will add that into a future version of the game.</p>
<p>The traditional Words game is an indefinite board, but this feature creates a finite board that includes the words it is given in addition to a few other randomized words. Once the game is created, the user can view the words that they need to find under the “Quests” menu, by clicking on the “hunt” quest that appears there. As they find each word, the word will be marked with a check in that menu. Users can also find other words from the chosen ‘domain’ as they play, but they do not count towards completing the quest. After finding all of the quest words, the user can open the “Quests” menu and click the check next to the quest that shows the quest is completed. Then, a dialog box appears to ask the user if they would like to start a new game or scramble the words of the current game to play again. Creating a new game will take the user back to the “Start Quiz” page. Choosing to scramble the words again changes the randomized seed used to create the game.</p>
<p>Seeds are related to how the game is randomized. Words is dependent on another code library built by Peter Mawhorter called “anarchy.” The point of that library is to create a way for randomized decisions to happen. The process that computers use to generate random numbers is actually mathematically based, so they are not as random as they appear. Each seed describes the pattern used to generate the random numbers. That is why each time you play the game with the same seed and same set of words, they will end up in the same places.</p>
<h3 id="challenges-1">Challenges</h3>
<p>One of the first challenges we ran into was figuring out whether to capitalize letters. Not every language has a sense of “uppercase” and “lowercase” letters like there is in English. We had to create a function that determined whether the applicable domain had letters (or glyphs) that could be capitalized, and if so, we had to develop the functionality to capitalize all the letters in the user’s uploaded word list.</p>
<p>We also found that some words from our uploaded word list were not recognized as valid words by the program. To fix this problem, we had to redefine what it meant for a word to be considered valid. Originally, Words determined whether a word was valid based on whether or not it was in one of the larger word lists (domains) that make up the game. We had to also allow for the case in which a word was not in a domain but was given to Words in the user’s custom word list.</p>
<p>Another challenge that our group encountered was how to encode the words and definitions together. We ultimately decided on using a URL, but that might need to be changed later. A URL has a set maximum length which might cause trouble for larger word lists. If a list only had words, someone could upload more than 200 words of average length into the game. However, once definitions are also added into the mix, it gets easier to reach the maximum length limit of a URL. Possible solutions to this problem include using the cookies of a website or sending the words through a form via a POST request. We hope that groups in the future can find a viable solution to this problem.</p>
<h3 id="future-work-1">Future Work</h3>
<p>As a word finding game that uses multiple languages, Words has the capability to be used in language pedagogy. By using definitions in quiz mode later, Words could have applications in the classroom as a way to review vocabulary. Right now, players can at least practice finding and spelling words, but hopefully in the future, they can also define words for learning purposes. With the current capabilities of the game, teachers can possibly send their students a link to a preset game with the given list of words that they need to review.</p>
