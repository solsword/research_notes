<h2>GLYPHS MENU</h2>
<h3 id="about-glyphs-menu">About Glyphs Menu</h3>
<p>The Glyphs Menu feature allows the user to complete words using a menu of letters available to them. On the left of the screen is a menu with five letters in it, if the user is struggling to complete a word and needs one more letter to do so, this feature would be useful for them. The user can simply stop dragging thier mouse on the grid and can press on the needed glyph from the menu and they can keep dragging their mouse on the grid.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="process-of-creating-the-glyphs-menu">Process of Creating the Glyphs Menu</h3>
<p>To make the glyphs menu, our group had to make a button menu and save the glyph or letter that was pressed. We also had to allow the user to choose words from an array other than the grid. The word game’s code only allowed the user to choose letters from an array of positions on the grid. To make the Glyphs Menu, we allowed the player to choose words from an array other than the position array. The code, then, checks for the index of the array and finds what letter is in that index and returns the letter.</p>
<h3 id="challenges">Challenges</h3>
<p>The Game Word is designed to be played in many different langauges. One of the biggest questions we were facing was how to make it more avaiable for all langauges. The Words game consists of thousands of lines of codes. One of the challanges we faced was working with a huge compile of code. One of the goals of our supervisor, Peter, was to make us familiar with working on a big compilation of code written previously.</p>
<h3 id="future-work">Future Work</h3>
<p>As the game develops, the Glyphs menu could be made mutable. It should gave the user options of adding more letters than just five and once a letter/glyph is selected it should not appear in the menu. However, these are all design questions and whether in the future the developers of the game decide to make these changes.</p>

<h2>QUIZ MODE</h2>
<p>If you would like to use this feature, we have a game initialized with a demo word list linked <a href="https://solsword.github.io/words/index.html#mode=quiz,words=science`definition%25201~computer`definition%25202~coding`definition%25203~html`definition%25204~css`definition%25205~javascript`definition%25206,domain=English">here</a>. You can also upload your own file into the quiz mode at this link: <a href="https://solsword.github.io/words/start_quiz.html">Start Quiz</a>.</p>

<h3 id="about-quiz-mode">About Quiz Mode</h3>
<p>In quiz mode, a user can upload a custom word list on a separate page from Words. First, the user must create a text file. The format for putting words into the file is described on the “Start Quiz” page linked above. Once they have their text file ready, they can choose which ‘domain’ that their text file falls under. Currently, our program supports English, Japanese (ひらがな), Turkish (türk), Chinese idioms (成语), and Arabic (عربى). Then, our program generates a link that encodes the words (and their definitions, if applicable) so that Words knows which words to use in the custom version of the game. Right now, our game does not have the capability to use the definitions, but we hope that someone will add that into a future version of the game.</p>
<p>The traditional Words game is an indefinite board, but this feature creates a finite board that includes the words it is given in addition to a few other randomized words. Once the game is created, the user can view the words that they need to find under the “Quests” menu. As they find each word, the word will be marked with a check in that menu. Users can also find other words that are randomly created as they play, but they do not count towards completing the quest. After finding all of the words, the user can open the “Quests” menu and click the check next to the quest that shows the quest is completed. Then, a dialog box appears to ask the user if they would like to start a new game or scramble the words of the current game to play again. Creating a new game will take the user back to the “Start Quiz” page. Choosing to scramble the words again changes the randomized seed used to create the game.</p>
<p>Seeds are related to how the game is randomized. Words is dependent on another code library built by Peter Mawhorter called “anarchy.” The point of that library is to create a way for randomized decisions to happen. The process that computers use to generate random numbers is actually mathematically based, so they are not as random as they appear. Each seed describes the pattern used to generate the random numbers. That is why each time you play the game with the same seed and same set of words, they will end up in the same place.</p>
<h3 id="challenges-1">Challenges</h3>
<p>One of the first challenges we ran into was figuring out whether to capitalize letters. Not every language has a sense of “uppercase” and “lowercase” letters like there is in English. We had to create a function that determined whether the applicable domain had letters (or glyphs) that could be capitalized, and if so, we had to develop the functionality to capitalize all the letters in the user’s uploaded word list.</p>
<p>We also found that some words from our uploaded word list were not recognized as valid words by the program. To fix this problem, we had to redefine what it meant for a word to be considered valid. Originally, Words determined whether a word was valid based on whether or not it was in one of the larger word lists (domains) that make up the game. We had to also allow for the case in which a word was not in a domain but was given to Words in the user’s custom word list.</p>
<p>Another challenge that our group encountered was how to encode the words and definitions together. We ultimately decided on using a URL, but that might need to be changed later. A URL has a set maximum length which might cause trouble for larger word lists. If a list only had words, someone could upload more than 200 words of average length into the game. However, once definitions are also added into the mix, it gets easier to reach the maximum length limit of a URL. Possible solutions to this problem include using the cookies of a website or sending the words through a form via a POST request. We hope that groups in the future can find a viable solution to this problem.</p>
<h3 id="future-work-1">Future Work</h3>
<p>As a word finding game that uses multiple languages, Words has the capability to be used in language pedagogy. By using definitions in quiz mode later, Words could have applications in the classroom as a way to review vocabulary. Right now, players can at least practice finding and spelling words, but hopefully in the future, they can also define words for learning purposes. With the current capabilities of the game, teachers can possibly send their students a link to a preset game with the given list of words that they need to review which can be useful in a classroom setting.</p>
