# Meeting Notes Summer 2020

## 2020-7-7 (discussion of operational logics)

- Definitions of "operational logics":
    * How the player makes meaning out of the abstract things going on in
      the game.
    * The connections you have to make to get a message out of the
      mechanics of a game. More than just the rules of the game.
    * A combination of different designs & mechanics + the way a user
      interacts creates an experience that conveys something to the
      player.
    * The specific procedural rhetorical strategies the designer users to
      affect the interactive experience of the player in an attempt to
      convey their message.

- Can operational logics be deployed in a novel (not a
  choose-your-own-adventure)?

- Maybe in some ways, but maybe not...?
- Maybe there's a continuum between completely-determined stories all the
  way to games?

- Formatting of a novel, like dates placed throughout the text, can maybe
  be kind of logic?
- Story build from newspaper clippings & fliers & stuff about activities
  in a single house, with lots of room to interpret the inner lives of
  the characters.

## 2020-6-16 (discussion of procedural rhetoric and newsgames)

- It's maybe problematic if people play a game like Kabul Kaboom to enjoy
  it.
- Things can go really sideways with the message.
- Depends on the player themselves.
- Going through the motions can be more persuasive than someone telling
  you something.
- Coming to a conclusion yourself is powerful.
- It can be very easy to miss the point of a game.
- Different mixes of rhetorical strategies.
- Death of the author.
- Talked about Brenda Braithwaite's Train.
- Procedural rhetoric in games you know?
    * Plague Inc. about virus spreads. Added warnings to the game to talk
      about the current situation.
    * Berlin conference game in European history class. Go split up
      Africa. Best way to win was by teaming up with other countries and
      forming an alliance.
    * Peter also played a game in elementary school about colonizing
      America.
    * Risk is another similar example. Some territories are worth more
      than others...
        * Resentment + teaming up + a lot of things.
    * Exploding kittens (card game where you draw cards that remove you
      from the game, and play cards to defuse them).
        * Frustrating + luck-based.
    * Chess: pawns get to upgrade at the end.
    * 2 lions, 20 sheep, lions need to each sheep, while sheep need to
      avoid isolation and block the lions.
        * If you stay together 
- Personal/social growth catalyzed by gameplay...
- Chess meanings:
    * War, pawns as expendable guards
    * Promotion at end of board is a sacrifice on the pawn's side of
      things.
    * Chinese chess is maybe on step less abstract than normal chess.
    * Players try to distract each other, which is also how things work
      in the real world.
- Interesting to have to think about accidental implications.
- These readings + conversations give a different perspective on games +
  the game that we're building as well.
- Why not make the news/rhetoric aspect of the game more obvious?
    * Maybe to convince more subtly?
- More evidence to tell relatives that playing games is beneficial/not a
  waste of time.


## 2020-6-16 (high-level goals resolution)

- Goals for this meeting:
   * For each team, decide what your high-level goal is.
       - Analyze feasibility.
       - Start breaking that down into subgoals.
- Goals after that: create a design document for your chosen high-level
  goal: just a short text document (although you can include pictures if
  you want) briefly describing how the stuff that you're working on will
  work when it's done.

## 2020-6-16 (first words game meeting)

- Goals for this meeting:
    1. Brainstorm goals: what are we working on?
    2. Decide on pairs.
    3. Translate goals into Trello tasks.
        * Top level will be at the level of (abstract) mechanics, like
          "Create a light/shadow mechanic."
        * One or more design subgoals for each mechanic.
        * Break things down into when/then statements (concrete
          mechanics/rules).
        * Break rules down into data structures, internal algorithms, and
          response functions.
        * As we work, create new Trello tasks for each sub-goal that comes into
          view.
    4. Create branches for each feature, and start working towards each
       goal.
        * Write code for the data structures, internal algorithms, and
          response function goals.
        * Move Trello tasks towards completion.
- Goals for this week and next: dictated by Trello.

        - Activities
            * Pair programming
            * Daily "scrum" meetings
            * Weekly code review
            * Trello for organizing and tracking progress
    * Week 6: Wrap-up including poster creation + maybe some paper
      writing.

    * Build your own demo using Anarchy.
    * Read the Anarchy workshop paper + the MDA framework paper (we'll
      discuss the MDA paper a bit early next week).
    * Figure out Slack, Trello, and Git.
    * If you want, start learning Vim + command line.
    * Complete responsible conduct of research training by Friday.
    * Fill out the first weekly summer research survey for the Science
      Center folks.
