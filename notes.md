# Meeting Notes Summer 2020

## 2020-6-16 (high-level goals resolution)

- Goals for this meeting:
   * For each team, decide what your high-level goal is.
       - Analyze feasibility.
       - Start breaking that down into subgoals.
- Goals after that: create a design document for your chosen high-level
  goal: just a short text document (although you can include pictures if
  you want) briefly describing how the stuff that you're working on will
  work when it's done.

## 2020-6-16 (first words game meeting)

- Goals for this meeting:
    1. Brainstorm goals: what are we working on?
    2. Decide on pairs.
    3. Translate goals into Trello tasks.
        * Top level will be at the level of (abstract) mechanics, like
          "Create a light/shadow mechanic."
        * One or more design subgoals for each mechanic.
        * Break things down into when/then statements (concrete
          mechanics/rules).
        * Break rules down into data structures, internal algorithms, and
          response functions.
        * As we work, create new Trello tasks for each sub-goal that comes into
          view.
    4. Create branches for each feature, and start working towards each
       goal.
        * Write code for the data structures, internal algorithms, and
          response function goals.
        * Move Trello tasks towards completion.
- Goals for this week and next: dictated by Trello.

            * Weekly code review
            * Trello for organizing and tracking progress
    * Week 6: Wrap-up including poster creation + maybe some paper
      writing.
